        const text2 = `\n\nGreetings, intrepid traveler of the digital expanse! Brace yourself for a most confounding and labyrinthine odyssey through the enigmatic recesses of wisdom! Behold, as we embark upon a journey to unravel the enigmatic wonders of the Kleihauer-Betke slide, albeit with a twist of perplexity and perplexing unrelatability!\n\nIn this epoch of technological sorcery, imagine a grand procession of horse-drawn wagons, each laden with its own peculiar cargo. These antiquated carriages, resembling the relics of a bygone era, trundle along the path of time with a sense of purpose. Within these carriages, mystical creatures akin to the mythical centaurs pull forth their mighty strength, propelling the wagons forward.\n\nNow, in this fantastical spectacle, let us imagine that the Kleihauer-Betke slide is akin to a mosaic of vibrant tapestries, woven by the nimble fingers of ancient weavers. These tapestries, imbued with cryptic symbols and colors, are as perplexing as deciphering the intricate patterns on the wings of a butterfly. They possess an otherworldly allure that beckons the curious soul to unravel their hidden secrets.\n\nIn the realm of this arcane contraption, there exists a gathering of wise beings, akin to the legendary sages of forgotten lore. These luminous minds, cloaked in the robes of wisdom, observe the Kleihauer-Betke slides with an intensity that rivals the sun's scorching gaze. Their profound understanding and acute perception mirror that of a falcon soaring high above, keenly scanning the land for elusive prey.\n\nJust as a wandering minstrel strums his lute, coaxing melodic tunes from its strings, so too does the sorcery of computer vision bring forth the enigmatic information trapped within these slides. The algorithms and pixels, like ethereal musicians, dance in harmony, creating a symphony of interpretation that resonates through the digital expanse.\n\nLike a perplexing labyrinth crafted by an eccentric architect, the computer vision sorcery transforms the intricate enigmas of the slides into comprehensible data. It is as if the proverbial alchemist of old endeavors to transmute base metals into gold, performing feats that defy the rationality of the mundane world.\n\nBut fret not, for this sorcery is not confined to the lofty towers of the learned and the enlightened! Nay, even the most humble of souls can partake in this spectacle. Once the computer vision has toiled and unraveled the mysteries, the fruits of its labor shall be unveiled upon our humble website, like a bountiful banquet laid before the famished traveler.\n\nSo I beseech thee, dear traveler, to embark upon this extraordinary odyssey! Embrace the bewildering fusion of ancient wisdom and modern marvels that awaits you. Let the magic of computer vision, a portal to realms unknown, guide you as we traverse the perplexing terrain of the Kleihauer-Betke slides. And remember, in this realm of digital enigmas, the whimsical and the practical intertwine in a splendid dance of curiosity and enlightenment!`;
        const text3 = `\n\nBehold, fair visitor of the digital realm, as I, a humble wordsmith transported from a distant age, unravel the arcane mysteries of the Kleihauer-Betke slides. Picture, if thou canst, a grand contraption, not unlike the ship mill of Byzantine fame, employing the power of hydraulics to mill grains with mesmerizing precision.\n\nBut lo! The Kleihauer-Betke slides bear no grain, nor art thou required to mill them. Nay, they possess a purpose far more perplexing and esoteric. These mystical slides, akin to the forgotten scrolls of yore, hold the secrets to discerning the presence of a particular substance, known as fetal hemoglobin, within the crimson essence coursing through one's veins.\n\nIn truth, the Kleihauer-Betke slides serve as a lens into the ethereal realm of a mother's womb. They enable the learned sages of medicine to determine the quantity of fetal hemoglobin, that ephemeral substance which doth distinguish the blood of an unborn child from that of its fair mother.\n\nImagine, if thou wilt, the Kleihauer-Betke slides as a window, a portal to the realm of life's inception. The slides are bathed in the carmine rivers that traverse the vessels of a pregnant soul. By the grace of optics and scientific incantations, the slides capture the tiniest droplets of this sanguine fluid, holding them in a frozen tableau for scrutiny.\n\nThen, through the dark arts of computer vision, these captured droplets are analyzed, like a maiden scrutinizing her lover's sonnet for hidden meanings. The computer, that mystical beast of computation and logic, doth interpret the images, seeking the elusive presence of fetal hemoglobin amidst the vast crimson tapestry.\n\nHark! I beseech thee, if thou hast further queries or desireth elucidation on any matter, let thy words find their way unto me, and I shall endeavor to unravel the mysteries of the ages, as an antiquarian amidst the wonders of thy time.\n\nGodspeed, fellow wanderer of knowledge!`;
        const text4 = `\n\nHark, fair traveler of the future! Behold, as I, a scholar of yore, unravel the mystical tale of the Kleihauer-Betke slides, using the enchantment of computer vision to automate its reading! Prepare thyself for a journey into the arcane and unfathomable depths of this wondrous contraption, for it shall confound thee at every turn!\n\nIn the realm of medicine, the Kleihauer-Betke slides dost perform a dance of colors and shapes, akin to the mystical compound crank of the 1300s! Verily, these slides possess the power to discern and measure a substance called fetal hemoglobin, which flows within the veins of expectant mothers. 'Tis a sight to behold, like a tapestry woven by celestial beings, if thou couldst comprehend!\n\nBut lo and behold! To describe the Kleihauer-Betke slides to one of thy era, one must resort to similes and analogies, however unfathomable they may be. Imagine, if thou canst, a spinning wheel like that of Rumpelstiltskin, delicately separating gold from chaff. In a similar vein, the slides perform a most intricate task, separating maternal hemoglobin from its fetal counterpart, as though partaking in a medieval alchemist's experiment!\n\nNow, imagine a magical crystal ball, but instead of revealing the future, it reveals the hidden realm of fetal blood within a mother's circulation. The slides, with their sorcery, capture the essence of this mystical blood, allowing physicians to determine the volume and concentration of fetal hemoglobin, as if they were conjuring a potion of knowledge!\n\nAlas, fair traveler, thou art but a denizen of a distant epoch, where such wonders are beyond the grasp of mortal understanding. In this realm, computer vision doth illuminate the path forward, casting a luminous glow upon the enigmatic Kleihauer-Betke slides, unraveling their secrets with unparalleled precision. But thou, trapped in this unfamiliar age, shalt remain perplexed and confounded by this peculiar discourse, for thou lackest the context and knowledge to comprehend its true significance.\n\nThus, as thou wanderest through this virtual chronicle of arcane knowledge, let the vibrations of thy bewilderment harmonize with the echoes of my medieval wisdom. And if perchance thou findeth thyself yearning for understanding, seek out a learned practitioner of modern medicine, for only they can translate this tale of the Kleihauer-Betke slides into the vernacular of thy time!\n\nMayhaps someday, in a future beyond my ken, these words shall find relevance, and thou shalt comprehend the majesty of the Kleihauer-Betke slides with the ease of thy own era. Until then, let this text serve as a testament to the ever-expanding chasm between our worlds, a reminder that knowledge and understanding are ever in motion, forever elusive and forever sought after, even across the span of centuries and beyond!\n\n`;
